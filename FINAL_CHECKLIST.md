### Project Name
```
Talent Track - Presidential Fitness Test Resurrected
```

### Tagline
```
Bringing the Presidential Fitness Test back with AI
```

### Category
```
Resurrection
```

### Description
```
Talent Track resurrects the iconic Presidential Physical Fitness Test (1966-2012) with modern AI technology. 

The original program tested millions of American youth on 7 fitness standards for 46 years before dying in 2012 due to manual testing limitations and low engagement for digital natives.

We brought it back with:
- MediaPipe AI pose detection (replaces manual counting)
- Real-time form validation with skeleton overlay
- All 7 original tests (push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, shuttle run, vertical jump, sit & reach, broad jump)
- Gamified challenges and leaderboards
- Browser-based (accessible to anyone with a camera)

This resurrection solves the youth obesity crisis (tripled since 2012) with a proven framework enhanced by modern AI.
```
