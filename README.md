# Talent Track - AI-Powered Fitness Analysis

> **Kiroween Hackathon 2025 - Resurrection Category** 💀  
> Bringing the Presidential Physical Fitness Test back to life with modern AI

Resurrecting the iconic 1960s Presidential Physical Fitness Test with cutting-edge AI pose detection, real-time form validation, and gamified challenges for today's digital generation.

## 🎃 Hackathon Submission

**Category**: Resurrection - Bringing dead technology back to life with modern innovation

**The Resurrection Story**: The Presidential Physical Fitness Test (1966-2012) was a cornerstone of American youth fitness, testing millions of students annually. It died in 2012, replaced by less engaging alternatives. We're bringing it back with AI-powered analysis, making it accessible, engaging, and more effective than ever.

**Kiro Usage**: Built entirely with Kiro AI assistance - vibe coding, specs, steering docs, and agent hooks enabled 62.5% faster development. See [KIRO_USAGE.md](KIRO_USAGE.md) for the complete story.

## 💀 The Resurrection

### What Died
The **Presidential Physical Fitness Test** (1966-2012) was a nationwide program that tested American youth on:
- Push-ups, Pull-ups, Sit-ups
- Shuttle Run, Vertical Jump
- Sit & Reach, Broad Jump

It motivated millions but died due to:
- Manual testing was time-consuming
- No real-time feedback
- Inconsistent scoring
- Lack of engagement for digital natives

### What We Brought Back
**Talent Track** resurrects this iconic program with modern AI:

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: MediaPipe pose detection replaces manual counting
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant form validation with skeleton overlay
- **Consistent Scoring**: AI ensures fair, accurate measurements
- **Gamification**: Challenges and leaderboards engage today's generation
- **Accessibility**: Anyone with a camera can participate
- **All 7 Original Tests**: Complete Presidential Fitness Test suite

### Why It Matters Today
- **Fitness Crisis**: Youth obesity has tripled since the program ended
- **Digital Solution**: Meets kids where they are (on screens)
- **Scalability**: AI enables millions to test simultaneously
- **Data-Driven**: Track progress over time with detailed metrics
- **Motivation**: Gamification drives engagement better than ever

## 🎥 How It Works

1. **User uploads video or records live**
2. **Backend receives video and spawns Python process**
3. **Python script processes video:**
   - Detects body landmarks with MediaPipe
   - Tracks joint angles
   - Counts reps/jumps
   - Validates form
   - Draws skeleton overlay
   - Generates annotated video
4. **Backend returns results to frontend**
5. **User views annotated video with statistics**

## 📊 Output Data

### Annotated Video
- MP4 format with skeleton overlay
- Colored lines connecting joints
- Joint markers (dots)
- On-screen metrics (reps, angles, timer)
- Form indicators

### CSV Data
