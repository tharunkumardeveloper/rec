# The Resurrection Story 💀

## What Died: Presidential Physical Fitness Test (1966-2012)

### The Golden Era

In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the **Presidential Physical Fitness Test** as a cornerstone of American youth fitness. For nearly half a century, this program:

- **Tested millions** of students annually across America
- **Set national standards** for youth fitness benchmarks
- **Motivated generations** with the prestigious Presidential Physical Fitness Award
- **Created healthy competition** among peers and schools
- **Established 7 core tests** that became iconic:
  1. Push-ups (upper body strength)
  2. Pull-ups (arm and back strength)
  3. Sit-ups (core endurance)
  4. Shuttle Run (speed and agility)
  5. Vertical Jump (explosive power)
  6. Sit & Reach (flexibility)
  7. Broad Jump (lower body power)

### The Death (2012)

The program was discontinued and replaced by "FitnessGram" due to critical limitations:

**Why It Failed**:
- ⏱️ **Time-Consuming**: Manual testing required significant teacher time
- 📊 **Inconsistent Scoring**: Human error led to unfair comparisons
- 😴 **Low Engagement**: Boring for digital-native generation
- 📉 **No Feedback**: Students got scores but no guidance on improvement
- 🏫 **Resource Intensive**: Required dedicated PE staff and equipment
- 📱 **Outdated**: Couldn't compete with screens and technology

**The Aftermath**:
- Youth obesity rates **tripled** (CDC data)
- Only **24% of youth** meet physical activity guidelines
- Fitness testing became fragmented and less motivating
- Loss of a unifying national fitness standard
